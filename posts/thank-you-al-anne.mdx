Dear Al-anne,

We hope that you had a lovely evening and are glad you were part of our celebration.   We had the perfect day and your presents made it even better.

Thank you for your generous gift and the very nice cutlery set that we'll use in all the shared meals to come in our marriage.  It was very thoughtful.

We love you!

Love,

Efrain and Jacquie
