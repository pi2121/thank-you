What you mean to me.

The day we met; I knew I had found my person.  Within 3 weeks we joked we were married and I knew we would someday be here.  I would like to read an extract written within our first years that holds true today:

Somehow serendipity & happenstance aligned our worlds in a way I can only understand as fate.  Without reservation or doubt we latched and clicked into each other like perfect puzzle pieces, completing an art canvas of a scenic landscape; except this art is alive and evolving in time.  We are the canvas but we are the artist as well as we tend to our art and keep changing for its betterment. In this landscape we host an ecosystem of fauna and flora working in harmony. Our flowers produce nectar for our bees and our bees pollinate our plants.  Our plants produce fruits for our butterflies. Together it's our picturesque little ecosystem.  Together this is our marriage.

What you taught me

That was written 7 years ago and since then we've been on this life path, learning together.  Your kindness and compassion have taught me to be a better man, an ally and an advocate.  It's inspired me to take a look at the choices I make and privileges I have.  I've learned to be a more effectively communicator and to share my feelings and thoughts.  I find such comfort in being able to tell you my deepest thought and not feel judged.  Through you, I've learned the value I bring to the table and found confidence in who I am.  I can be me with you.

What I vow for our future

I know it won't always be easy and I expect the challenges to come our way; but there is no one I would rather have by my side.  I know that we are stronger together and as a team.

I promise to you be you rock and home base.  To me that means putting in time to work and develop myself.  It means being strong in adversity and shining my light.  It means doing the small things.  

I promise to give you space to create and grow.  To explore your potential as a creator and to turn your summer of love into a life time of love.  To express your true self and support your aspirations and goals.

I promise to challenge you.  As much as I know I can support you, I know that sometimes you need a friendly nudge.
